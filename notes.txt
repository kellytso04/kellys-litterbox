Log into psql’s CLI using: psql -d databasename -U username

MISC NOTES:
- db and server go on separate ec2s
- another option is skip docker, deploy, and then go back + use docker + deploy again

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Dockerize your database & server without Docker Compose
Perform a PG DUMP, which is when you dump all of your data into an sql file
Run cmd `pg_dump sdc > backup.sql` in terminal
This will store all of the data to be dumped in a file called `backup.sql`,
which stores all the data as a backup in case something goes wrong while Dockerizing
Once this is done, you can safely build the image for your database

Challenge: we're experiencing a connection error due to a
duplicate host, so we'll need to create another host
Solution: In `db/config.js`, we've created a `host` prop in the pool object
and set it to `host.docker.internal`, which will create a separate host for us to use

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: I'd like to add my db/config.js file to .dockerignore so that my
personal database login information doesn't get uploaded. I'd instead replace it
with a db/config.example.js file so that anyone who uses this repository can
simply plug their information in and use it.

Steps to solve this:
- Go into docker container
- Create db/config.js there
- Manually edit it with vim
- Upload that file to database's EC2 instance

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Getting an issue because my db/config.js is using Postgres's default port
5432. Resident recommended I look into a solution where I get the Postgres port
forwarded to the Docker container.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Learning to create Postgres instance in Docker

Steps:
- Download postgres image
- Run cmd `docker run —name postgres-sdc -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sdc -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine` in terminal
- Run cmd `docker exec -it postgres-sdc bash` to enter the container

Notes:
- `docker ps` cmd shows all currently-running instances
