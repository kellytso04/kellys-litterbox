## Litterbox
**Litterbox** is the back-end API that supports our front-end capstone project, _Catwalk_. 

## Getting set up
This codebase requires a **GitHub API token**.
Within the codebase, locate the file `config.example.js`, make a copy of it titled `config.js`, and replace the placeholder text with your personal access token. That's it!

# The database
This repository uses **PostgreSQL**. If you have already have Postgres installed on your local machine, all you need to do is create a database through the terminal, navigate to `db/config.sample.js`, make a copy of it titled `config.js`, and replace the placeholder text with your database login information.
